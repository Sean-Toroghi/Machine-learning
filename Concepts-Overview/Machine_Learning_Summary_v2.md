<h1>Machine learning - unconentional approach</h1>

This summary explores machine learning through the unifying framework of the energy model. This perspective effectively connects diverse machine learning concepts. Unlike conventional approaches that typically begin with supervised learning, introduce various model architectures, and conclude with unsupervised learning, this framework establishes the energy model as a foundational concept for all machine learning methodologies. By adopting this approach, it becomes evident how disparate machine learning paradigms—including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, classification, regression, generative models, probabilistic models, and specialized areas like reinforcement learning—all share the fundamental core of the energy model.

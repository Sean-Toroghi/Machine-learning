<h1>Machine learning - quick reference</h1>

# Steps involve in a machine learning project

A machine learning prject, in its general form, goes through the following phases:
0. define problem
1. collecting and aquiring data
2. preprocess and clean data
3. select algorithm apprpriate for the task in hand, and process of selecting best algorithm among all cadidates
  - develop a baseline to evalue model performance in the next step
  - training process and optimizing the model to gain highest performance, including fine-tuneining, hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking. 
4. evaluate model and examine its generalization capability

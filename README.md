# Data science life cycle

At the heart of data science lies the data science life cycle, a systematic, iterative process that guides data-driven problem-solving across various industries and domains.

1. The first stage of the data science life cycle involves defining the problem, which entails understanding the business context, articulating objectives, and formulating hypotheses.
2. Once the data is analyzed, the data science life cycle progresses to model selection, training, evaluation, and tuning.
3. Lastly, the data science life cycle emphasizes the importance of deploying the final model into a production environment, monitoring its performance, and maintaining it to ensure its ongoing relevance and accuracy.

Key steps in the data science lifecycle:
- define the problem:
- data collection
- data preparation
- data exploration
- model selection
- model training
- model evaluation
- model tuning
- model deployment
- model monitoring and maintenance
- communicate results

# Project 1 - develop a recommender system model to recommend books based on user ratings

Description: In this mini-project, an item-based recommender system is developed, using correlation coefficient. First a utility matrix is generated. Then via SVD method, the generated utilty matrix is compressed. Finally correlation matrix is created using Peirson correlation. Finally, an application of this model is illustrated by providing recommendation on two levels, for books with similar ratings to target book titled '1984'.

# Project 2 - develop a recommender system model to improve performance of an online marketing campaign

Description: In this mini-project, a user-based recommender system is developed, using Naive Bayes Classifier. The model predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement or not, by training the model on dataset containing information about other users and their response to the advertisement. 

# Project 3 - develop a recommender system model to identify relevant real estate recommendations for properties in Melbourne, Australia.

Description: In this mini-project, a content-based recommender system is developed, using nearest neighbor algorithm that generates recommendations based on the userâ€™s previous search behavior on an online real estate portal.

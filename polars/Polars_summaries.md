<h1>Polars - summary</h1>

Polars package is a fast data processing and manupulation tool built on top of Rust. While, in general, it resembles methods in Pandas, for most cases it uses different names, approache, and structure for doring the same task. In many cases, I find it beneficial to have a quick reminder while coding in Polars. Not only it saves a good time, but also it helps me to pratice more efficiently. I tried to keep the balance between  breadth and depth, and structure it for quick referencing.
